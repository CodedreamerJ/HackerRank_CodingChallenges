# HackerRank_CodingChallenges

#Purpose

HackerRank coding challenges provide me with essential knowledge in data structures. Data Structures is core to Object Oriented Programming.
In addition to understanding and implementing Data Structures, many of these challenges focus on both time complexity and space complexity. 
Therefore, providing guidance on how to write efficient and effective code. Lastly, technical jobs require potential candidates to take 
coding exams focusing on data structures as well as time and space complexity. 

#Goals

I plan is to test my knowledge of data structures by attempting and completing a number of HackerRank's challenges. 
My goal simply is to become a better programmer and ultimately know when and how to implement the right data structure. 
At the same time, I will also focus namely on time and space complexity in order to write efficient code.
